About me
I'm an Engineering Student studying at Simon Fraser University, working in embedded electonics and pcb design. I enjoy solving problems and learning from them, as well as optmizing code/designs.
My main interests are low level and pcb design. My current goals that I am working towards are creating a motherboard for a mobile device using the RK3588 SOC, and designing an affordable, opensource pick-and-place machine with a heated bed.
